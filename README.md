TODO : (so far):
First fetch necessary stock data , atleast the values of 200 stocks to be precise. And work out on implement an API which provides and connects seamlessly with the frontend.


STICKS DESCEND
Sticks descend is a sorting algorithm visualiser based on the web. Most visualisations use randomly generated integer values to work with. The unique aspect of this project is in accordance with the fact that it uses stock price data and map it out to values suitable and ready to be sorted and visualised using front end manipulations.
The core backend of the project is written entirely in JULIA, inside of backends <sample>.jl files, where as the front end stuff is wrapped inside of SVELTE framework.


Reference and inspirations:
Most of the sorting algorithms seen here were inspired by a github repository i came across a while ago. You can take a look on it by yourself : https://github.com/bingmann/sound-of-sorting
This project was apparently embraced graciously by the meme community all over youtube.

Note: the following stuff is about the sound-of-sorting github repository.
